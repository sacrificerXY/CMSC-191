### NOTE: Files compiled/tested with ~~Java 11~~ Java 8 
Just realized that even though **JDK 11** was installed, the files were actually being compiled with **Java 8** due to misconfigured **PATH** variable. Even though it's fixed now and can compile to Java 11, **all programming assignments will be compiled with Java 8** for better compatibility with other systems.
